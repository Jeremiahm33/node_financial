My application is at -->  http://sailsfinancial-williammiller.rhcloud.com/ 

1) Frameworks are now available for pretty much all development environments. Explain the value of a framework like Sails.js. What are the positive aspects, and what are the negative aspects of a framework?
    
    Sails is a very easily learned framework that allows for novice users, such as myself, to construct scalable, customer built applications. It is a logical structure for interactive systems. The positive aspects include the support for modern day applications like data-driven api's or even multi-player games. Some of the drawbacks include limitations upon the framework's core behavior, your code is public, and novice developers learn the framework and not the language. I have to say that is where I fall although, I did learn quite a bit on both sides of that argument.

2) What applications could benefit from using a framework?

  I suppose it really depends on the application on whether it would benefit from a framework or not. If your application needs to be efficient, put together fast, cost effective, and with a lot of community support, then a framework is for you. Basically, any start-up application that needs a cheap framework that is versatile and scalable with no known growth limit, it is a very good tool.

3) Describe an application where a framework may not be appropriate.

  Anything that might have the potential to expose a user's personal or financial information might not be the best use for a framework. As easy as it is to development in this framework, it means it is just as easy to violate by persons with bad intentions. So, anything that is considered a high-level (or less depending on the app) data by most security policies should be re-evaluated for use on a framework.

4) Describe 3 things you learned from this assignment.

  Wow! What didn't I learn from this assignment? I was exposed to a wide variety of distributed systems that are actually being implemented in a current status. I learned how to do some basic XML, JSON, and JavaScript (which I found the most useful) that was used in a Node.js environment. I also learned that I have a lot to learn. I built a web-interfaced database application that called on data through an api. What could be cooler than that? I don't mean to ramble but, (lol) I started this journey well aware that I was going to attempt something that most people from my career field and age would never even consider. I was nervous that I just wouldn't "get it" and never succeed. I may not know as much as some of my fellow students that have some experience with this from jobs, hobbies, or outright brilliance but, I can say that I have learned to develop some amazing things. I can't express the gratitude to have the skill set to teach an 'ol concrete worker how to build a Sails application. I learned how to configure MyPhp and OpenShift to meet my development needs. So, to spare your bleeding ears now... I learned a lot!

5) How could this assignment be improved?

  The only thing I could say to "adjust" this assignment is maybe spread out the implementation of so many new tools and computer languages. It took me quite a bit to get with it as far as the large amount of new utensils we were using. In no way could you improve it because I really appreciated the time to actually learn and not kamikaze my grade due to slower skills. Thank you.
